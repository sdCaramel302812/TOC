#### Secret Data

`VERIFY_TOKEN` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` **MUST** be set to proper values.
Otherwise, you might not be able to run your code.

#### Run Locally
You can either setup https server or using `ngrok` as a proxy.

**`ngrok` would be used in the following instruction**

```sh
./ngrok http 5000
```

After that, `ngrok` would generate a https URL.

#### Run the sever

```sh
python3 app.py

		* Reply: "I'm entering state1"

	* Input: "go to state2"
		* Reply: "I'm entering state2"
